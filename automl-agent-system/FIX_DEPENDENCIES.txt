FIXING THE "VITE IS NOT RECOGNIZED" ERROR
========================================

The error means the project dependencies aren't properly installed.

SOLUTION - Run these commands in order:
=====================================

1. Open Command Prompt in the project folder (like you just did)

2. First, clean any existing installation:
   npm cache clean --force

3. Delete node_modules folder (if it exists):
   rmdir /s node_modules

4. Install all dependencies fresh:
   npm install

5. Now try starting the server:
   npm run dev

STEP BY STEP COMMANDS:
=====================
Copy and paste these one by one:

npm cache clean --force
rmdir /s node_modules
npm install
npm run dev

WHAT THIS DOES:
==============
- Cleans npm cache
- Removes old node_modules
- Reinstalls all dependencies (including vite)
- Starts the development server

After "npm install" completes, you should see a node_modules folder
with thousands of files. Then "npm run dev" will work.

IF YOU STILL GET ERRORS:
=======================
Check if Node.js is properly installed:
- Type: node --version
- Type: npm --version

If those don't work, download and install Node.js from:
https://nodejs.org/ (choose LTS version)
